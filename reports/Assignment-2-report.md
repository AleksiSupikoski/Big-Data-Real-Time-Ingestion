# 1 - Batch data ingestion pipeline 

### 1.1 The ingestion will be applied to files of data. Define a set of constraints for files that mysimbdp will support for ingestion. Design a configuration model for the tenant service profile that can be used to specify a set of constraints for ingestion (e.g., maximum number of files and amount of data). Explain why you as a platform provider decide such constraints. Implement these constraints into simple configuration files and provide examples (e.g., JSON or YAML)
